# Parkinson's Prediction System

## Problem statement
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Early detection is key to initiating timely treatment and slowing disease progression. However, current diagnostic methods are often invasive, costly, and require specialized medical expertise, leading to delays in diagnosis.

Speech and audio-based biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for early PD detection. These biomarkers can be extracted from voice recordings and analyzed to identify subtle changes associated with the disease. However, developing robust and real-time models to process diverse and noisy time-series audio data remains a significant challenge.
